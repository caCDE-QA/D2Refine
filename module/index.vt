    <h1>D2Refine Extension</h1>
    
    <p>If an extension needs its own page, then this is such an example.
      However, mostly, extensions only need to inject their own scripts
      and styles into the /project page.

    <p>Here is someString: $someString, and someInt: $someInt</p>
    
    <p>Here is a D2Refine list using a veloci-macro:</p>
    
    #set( $greatlakes = ["Superior","Michigan","Huron","Erie","Ontario"] )
    #makeAList( $greatlakes )
